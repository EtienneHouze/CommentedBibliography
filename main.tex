    \cite{marcus2018innateness} is a discussion on the article presenting AlphaZero as a \emph{tabula rasa} method \cite{silver2017mastering}. It objects that since it has been engineered by experts in the go game, its very architecture already carries some specificities aimed at solvig this particular problem.

    \cite{russell2016artificial} is a good handbook presenting the main techniques in AI. In particular, it describes knowledge-based systems and logic representation of the environment (Part III).
