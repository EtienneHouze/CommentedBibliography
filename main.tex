    \cite{marcus2018innateness} is a discussion on the article presenting AlphaZero as a \emph{tabula rasa} method \cite{silver2017mastering}. It objects that since it has been engineered by experts in the go game, its very architecture already carries some specificities aimed at solvig this particular problem.

    \cite{russell2016artificial} is a good handbook presenting the main techniques in AI. In particular, it describes knowledge-based systems and logic representation of the environment (Part III). Other parts are interesting too, but not as much linked to this work.

    \cite{dessalles2015conceptual}  presents an approach to define and name concepts in a geometric space (Contrast). It comes from the works in \cite{gardenfors2004conceptual} which introduces the existence of dimensions in the conceptualisation of the environment.

    \cite{dessalles2008computational} defines a conflict as a situation when an event happens but is not desired, or when a desired event is not observed. It also presents a conflict resolution based on CAN. This approach can be used to generate dialogue between the user and the system in case of a conflict.

    \section{To read}

    \cite{amarasinghe2018toward} examines a framework to explain decision made by DNNs in case an anomaly happens.
